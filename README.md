 Blockchain Pension System :Securing Futures
Project Overview
Blockchain Pension System is a blockchain-based pension management system built on the Stellar network, designed to revolutionize pension management in East Africa. Our solution addresses critical challenges in the region's pension systems, including unreliable schemes, insecure inheritance processes, and inefficient operations.

Key Features
Blockchain-Powered: Built on the Stellar network for secure and transparent transactions.

Smart Contracts(to be built using soroban): Automate pension transactions to reduce intermediaries and enhance efficiency.

Wallet Management (a provision for multisigi wallets wc provides support for sucere inheritance incase the wallet holder is no more): Users can open and manage wallets with predefined instructions and settings.

Fund & Withdraw: Allows funding and restricted withdrawals based on set conditions.

Asset Growth Tracking: Real-time monitoring of pension growth.

Future Innovations: USSD intergration access for wider reach and NFT document storage for secure ownership.

Business Model
Our sustainable model includes:

Transaction fees for pension management and processing.

Premium features for advanced tracking.

Partnerships with financial institutions and other pension schemes that are ready into existance i.e NSSF in uganda ,and private pension management companies in uganda

Target Market
Informal sector workers.

Small and medium enterprises (SMEs).

Existing pension scheme members in Uganda and across East Africa.

Competitive Advantage
Blockchain Security: Ensures transparency and prevents fraud.

Automation: Reduces human error and processing time.

Cost Efficiency: Lowers operational costs by minimizing intermediaries.

Regional Focus: Tailored to meet the specific needs of East African markets.
